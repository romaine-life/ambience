# ambience

Shared-world ambient pixel-art effect system. Server coordinates state;
every client (browser canvas, terminal sixel) runs its own sim replica
that receives config + event broadcasts via SSE. Conceptually independent
of fzt — the name only matches the domain (`ambience.romaine.life`).
Read `D:/shell-config/setup/claude/CLAUDE.md` for global Claude config.

## Container Build Verification

Agent pods are not expected to have Docker. Do not report missing local Docker
as a blocker. Run available repo checks first, then use PR CI as the normal
container build gate: `.github/workflows/docker-build-check.yml` performs
throwaway builds for the app and native-runner images with `push: false`. If
image-packaging feedback is needed before a PR is ready, manually dispatch that
workflow with `git_ref`. Release/deploy workflows are the only path that
publishes images.

## Architecture

sim/             Pure Go simulation logic. Rain is the only effect today.
                 No I/O; consumed by cmd/ambience (server-side) and by
                 terminal/ (client-side sixel renderer).

terminal/        Go package — SSE subscriber + local sim replica + sixel
                 renderer. Consumed by fzt-automate via its
                 PostFrameHook. See `docs/terminal-integration-status.md`
                 for open issues (flicker, opacity, accumulation).

                 `values-prod.yaml` drives the live app at
                 `ambience.romaine.life`; `values-dev.yaml` drives the
                 flexible dev environment at `ambience.dev.romaine.life`.
                 ArgoCD Applications live in
                 `infra-bootstrap/k8s/apps/{ambience,ambience-dev}.yaml`.
                 CI is manual / session-driven:
                 `.github/workflows/build-and-deploy.yml` has no automatic
                 triggers and only builds + pushes
                 `romainecr.azurecr.io/ambience:<sha>` when manually
                 dispatched. The follow-up image-tag bump commit is done
                 from the session by editing the appropriate Helm values
                 file, then ArgoCD picks up that committed chart change
                 and rolls out.
```

## Atmosphere model

The server does NOT broadcast pixel frames. Instead, each atmosphere is a
server-side Rain sim running at 10 Hz whose job is to DECIDE when discrete
events fire and when to rotate scenes. Clients run their own sims locally
and apply five kinds of commands:

- **`snapshot`** — initial state dump on connect. Full game-save:
  `{type, tick, config, state, seed, gridW, gridH, currentScene,
  nextScene, entropyBytes, sceneRemaining}`. `type` is the effect name
  ("rain" for now); `config` and `state` are the effect-specific payloads.
- **`config`** — sim config changed; clients call `setConfig`. Broadcast on
  entry to scene transitions (at ~1 Hz during drift) and on transition
  completion (final target for exact sync).
- **`trigger`** — an event fired (downpour/calm/gust/splash); clients apply.
- **`scene`** — scene rotated. Carries `{name, durationTicks, startedAtTick,
  nextName, transitionTicks}` so UI panels update + interpolated tick
  interpolation works.
- **`metric`** — entropy bytes + scene-remaining snapshot. Event-driven,
  not periodic — fires on every `AddEntropy` call and on scene rotation.

Clients do NOT roll for discrete events — only the server does. Clients
advance timers and physics locally. Frame-level sync is not guaranteed
(each client RNG drifts after initial snapshot), but event timing
(downpour starts/ends, calm windows, scene changes) stays in sync.

## Scene rotation

Rain runs with generated scenes rather than a single fixed config.
Scenes have a 1–4 h duration, two-slot lookahead (current + next, next
pre-generated at rotation time using the atmosphere's RNG — entropy
perturbs the RNG, so keystrokes bias future scenes with a one-scene
delay). Scene names are auto-derived descriptors (`warm-fast-drizzle`,
`cool-calm-downpour`) from hue/speed/spawn buckets.

Transitions between scenes are a config DRIFT — `lerpConfig` over
`min(60 s, sceneDur/2)` ticks with `easeInOutCubic` easing. Hue uses
angular LERP so the 0/360° seam is crossed along the shortest arc.
Server applies interpolated configs to its sim each tick and broadcasts
every 10 ticks during drift (~1 Hz), so client replicas stay near-sync
without overwhelming the SSE stream. See
[#8](https://github.com/nelsong6/ambience/issues/8) for the larger
cross-effect transition design; the current work is the within-effect
half. Vocabulary (Scene vs Effect) is tracked in
[#17](https://github.com/nelsong6/ambience/issues/17).

For local testing, `AMBIENCE_SCENE_TICKS=60` env var shortens scene
duration to 6 s so rotations fire visibly without a 90-minute wait.
Production ignores the var (falls back to 1–4 h random).

## Effect registry

`sim.js` exports `AmbienceSim.effects = { rain: Rain }`. The shared
`client.js` reads `snapshotData.Type` and looks up the constructor there
— adding a new effect means registering one entry in `effects`, no
client-side change, no per-consumer change. The 5-slot effect template
(spawn / lever / event / event-mod / end) is in the ambience repo
issues: [#1](https://github.com/nelsong6/ambience/issues/1).

## Guiding principle

One of ambience's guiding principles is to copy the *boundaries* that
make simulation-heavy systems like Noita compelling, without trying to
clone their exact engine.

- Keep authoritative world truth compact and semantic. The server should
  decide important events, phases, and state transitions; clients should
  do the expensive local replay/render work.
- Keep the transport generic at the envelope level and effect-owned on
  the inside. Snapshot/config/trigger/schema are shared seams; each
  effect owns its own inner state and tuning knobs.
- Aggregate secondary systems instead of mirroring every particle.
  Persistence, logs, metrics, entropy, and future audio should describe
  meaningful simulation state, not become a raw firehose of per-pixel
  updates.
- Prefer stable control seams over effect-specific special cases. New
  effects should plug into the registry, schema, snapshot/restore, and
  trigger paths instead of requiring consumer-specific wiring.

## Entropy flow

Browsers capture `keydown` events and POST a byte per keystroke
(`key.charCodeAt(0) ^ Date.now() & 0xff`) to `/entropy` every 2s
(throttled, max 4KB per request). The server folds bytes into the
shared atmosphere's seed and re-seeds the sim's RNG via
`Rain.PerturbRNG(delta)`. Future random decisions drift — typing subtly
steers the world. Cheap, lossy, intentional — this is aesthetic
perturbation, not secure randomness.

## Consumer integration

The shared auto-init pattern. Drop this into any page:

```html
<canvas data-ambience></canvas>
<script src="https://ambience.romaine.life/sim.js"></script>
<script src="https://ambience.romaine.life/client.js"></script>
```

Then CSS (optional, for layered overlay):

```css
#ambience-canvas { position: fixed; inset: 0; z-index: 0; pointer-events: none; }
body.ambience-on { --fzt-bg: transparent; }  /* or other opacity overrides */
```

`client.js` adds `body.ambience-on` on successful init — consumer CSS
can conditionally adapt so the page still renders correctly if ambience
JS fails to fetch. Configuration via `data-ambience-*` attrs on the
canvas: `url`, `grid-w`, `grid-h`, `transparent`, `entropy`.

Consumers:

- **`/`** — live broadcast monitor. Full-screen canvas running the shared
  replica sim (via inline EventSource + sim.js, not `client.js` — the page
  consumes all five command kinds including `scene`/`metric` which
  `client.js` doesn't know about). Status-panel overlay shows current scene
  name, remaining time, up-next, tick, entropy counter with togglable
  capture, and a rolling event log. Dev-ish tools here are a
  fallback — `/dev` remains the real knob-tuning surface.
- **`/dev`** — per-session dev-atmosphere knob-tuning page. NOT connected to
  the shared broadcast; each session gets its own isolated atmosphere for
  testing effects/configs without interfering with prod state.
- **fzt-showcase** — `<canvas data-ambience>` behind the WASM DOS terminal.
- **my-homepage** — `<canvas data-ambience>` behind the fzt bookmark terminal.
- **fzt-automate** (terminal) — imports `github.com/nelsong6/ambience/terminal`,
  paints sixel via `tui.PostFrameHook`. Currently has known rendering
  issues tracked in #11–#15; on pause.

## Decisions settled

- Name: `ambience` (matches `ambience.romaine.life`)
- Language: Go server + sim + terminal client; JS for browser consumers
- First effect: Rain ([#2](https://github.com/nelsong6/ambience/issues/2))
- Shared state is global across all consumers/profiles
- K8s-native deploy — first app on the per-app deployment pattern
  (see `infra-bootstrap/k8s/apps/ambience.yaml`)
- Effects plug in via `AmbienceSim.effects` registry; server broadcasts
  `snapshotData.Type` so clients know which constructor to pick. Adding
  Sand/Fire/Tetris requires zero client changes.
- Repo migration from `nelsong6/` → `romaine-life/` tracked by
  [#10](https://github.com/nelsong6/ambience/issues/10) (May 2026)

## Status

Rain MVP live at `ambience.romaine.life` with scene rotation + smooth
drift transitions + live monitor panel at `/`. Consumers: fzt-showcase +
my-homepage integrated via shared client (unaffected by scene/metric
commands — client.js ignores unknown kinds). Entropy intake wired,
visible on the `/` panel. Terminal integration tabled, see
`docs/terminal-integration-status.md`. Persistence of shared atmosphere
state across pod restarts is open —
[#16](https://github.com/nelsong6/ambience/issues/16). Future effects
ready to plug in via the registry.
